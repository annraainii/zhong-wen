- Know and follow the eight basic stroke order rules. 

	The Chinese language is a very straightforward and systematic language, especially the characters. Each character must be written in a certain way in order to be 100% accurate. Therefore, it’s absolutely essential for Chinese students to follow the stroke order rules. Basically, if you follow the eight ground rules of “stroke order,” you should be good to go. They are:

	1. Top before bottom.
	2. Left before right.
	3. Left vertical stroke (usually) before top horizontal stroke.
	4. Bottom horizontal stroke last.
	5. Center stroke before wings.
	6. Horizontal strokes before intersecting vertical strokes.
	7. Left-falling strokes before right-falling strokes.
	8. Minor strokes (often) last.
