## Pronunciation Set 1

These were the sets of pronunciations based on the consonants "b, p, m, f, d, t, n, l".
For practise on the use of consonants and vowels, you may use the first tone.

(New) Where the combination with a single vowel doesn't exist, I've added an additional "ng" behind the vowel, as far as possible.
Where the combination with the vowel doesn't exist at all, it is denoted with "-".

## Pronunciation Set 2

The next set composes of the consonants "g, k, h".

|     |    |   | a    | o     | e    | i   | u   |
|-----|----|---|------|-------|------|-----|-----|

## Pronunciation Set 3 

The next set composes of the consonants "z, c, s, zh, ch, sh, r".
Note, these consonants specifically pronounce "i" differently (almost with clenched teeth).

|     |    |   | a    | o     | e    | i     | u   |
|-----|----|---|------|-------|------|-------|-----|
| 12. | z  |   | zā   | zōng  | zē   |**zī** | zū  |

| 14. | s  |   | sā   | sōng  | sē   |**sī** | sū  |
|     |    |   |      |       |      |       |     |
| 15. | zh |   | zhā  | zhōng | zhē  |**zhī**| zhū |
| 16. | ch |   | chā  | chōng | chē  |**chī**| chū |
| 17. | sh |   | shā  | shōu  | shē  |**shī**| shū |
| 18. | r  |   | rāng | rōng  | rē   |**rī** | rū  |

*"ra" and "shong" do not exist.*

## Pronunciation Set 4

The next set composes of the consonants "j, q, x, y, w".
Note: "y, w" are not traditionally included in the set of consonants practised in school and as such, has been added last. 

Umlaut Effect
- The consonants "j, q, x, y" pronounce "i" normally", but the "u" with an umlaut effect (no special notation).
- The consonants "n, l" also pronounce "u" with an umlaut effect when specifically denoted with ü.
- Don't be confused, "w" has **no** umlaut effect.

The consonant "y" pronounces "e" differently.
